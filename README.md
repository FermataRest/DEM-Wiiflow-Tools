This repository includes a variety of Python scripts that automate the process of renaming and organizing retro game files and their corresponding cover art. The scripts are designed to match game and cover title files to specific naming conventions, ensuring consistency across collections, and assist with integrating the proper file extensions for each title.

Key Features
Automated File Renaming: Scripts automatically detect and rename files, including .zip, .bin, .cue,.A26,.D64, and other common formats, based on predefined text lists.

Specialized Naming Conventions: Handle specific cases such as converting Roman numerals to Arabic numerals, retaining disc numbers in filenames, and managing complex title structures.

Text Extraction and Processing: Tools for extracting game titles from web pages and exporting them to text files, making it easier to keep track of large collections and create new text lists for the scripts.

Support for Multiple Platforms:

Scripts cater to various retro gaming platforms, including SNES, GBC, Genesis, and Commodore 64, with the flexibility to create others just by changing up some prompts with each script.
Iterative Processing: Scripts are designed to run iteratively, ensuring all files are correctly renamed in one go, with ongoing checks for changes and updates.
