***Basic info***

You will need Python installed on your PC to run the script.

This tool will only read ZIPPED games for this system. For the NES the game extension will have to be in ".zip" format

Boxart cover size is 1090x680

in order for Wiiflow to see your boxart, all title names from both the "games" and "boxart" need to match 100% 
Example:[game title]".zip" and [game title]".zip.png."  (cover art file extensions must end in the extensions above followed by .png or wiiflow will not read it).



*****GAME SORTING SCRIPTS******
open them in order where ever your games are located and it will help sort a lot of titles like "Jap,Proto,Eu,hack" and a few others.


"Zip Sorter (Use first).py" = The first script is organizing files into specific folders based on whatâ€™s in their names (like "Japan" or "Europe").

"Reorganizer (Use second).py" = The second script is checking folders (Japan and Europe) and moving any files that are missing from the main 
folder into that folder.


one is sorting, and the other is gathering.



***Using the tool***

Before using the tool you need to setup the folders inside.

Place your NES games in the "nes games" folder making sure they are zipped and in the ".zip" format

after that if you have your boxart, also make sure that it's unzipped and placed in the "nes cover art" folder.

(if you have folders called "ALT" or "demo" inside the box art file you downloaded) i usually just delete them. I just use the default ones for my region (USA).
alt files can cause duplicate titles after the conversion process to appear and make covers not work.


assuming you have both of those things done, then you're good to go to run the script. (Provided you have python installed).


all you have to do from here is just open "DAT-NES-Wiiflow-Tool.py" and follow the prompts. 


Your renamed boxart for use in Wiiflow will now be located in "renamed cover art" with the file extensions fixed for you! (".zip.png")


*****FILE LOCATIONS*****

after thats done, assuming you followed my guide "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-aV3whflOQ&t=513s"

then you can place the NES games when done into the "roms--->nintendo--->NES" folder on your Wii SD card

and place the box art into the "Wiiflow--->boxcovers---->nintendo--->NES" folder

******OR*******

When the script is complete you can auto transfer your files to the SD/USB by running the "Transfer to SD-USB (NES).py" script and following the prompts.



and thats it! Enjoy. -Below Average Gaming
