So unlike every other script that i made with these tools i actually didnt have to do much to this one.

i made this tool based around the "MAME2003" romset


if you get your cover art from the gbatemp   ("https://gbatemp.net/threads/cover-collections-for-emulators-with-cover-support.324714/")
it comes already renamed to the .zip.png format needed for wiiflow to see it. so no need for a conversion!



now as for the roms. 9 times out of 10 if you see a mame rom it will likly have a weird name that you dont recognize, Mame will be able to read those names just
fine though. but for your own information i included another .txt file called "which mame games are which.txt"

this will give you a list of the real mame names and there description so you'll know whats what.



MAME has a BAJILLION games and not all of them work on the Wii. so since we dont need to rename anything to make the boxart work this time then i figured the
least i could do is make a script that will seperate the known working MAME games on the Wii from from a rom folder that has more mame games in it.

this compatibility list is based on the infomation from here 
"https://gbatemp.net/threads/mame-wii-1-0-recompilation-with-newer-wiimote-support-wiiflow-support-via-arguments-for-autolaunch-games.630959/page-2"



****How to use***


All you have to do is open the script and it will ask you to drag in a folder containing ALL of your MAME games "preferrably MAME2003".
drag that in and then it will ask you to drag in the "mame2003 working wii list.txt" (included in the folder) and the script will auto match the names on that
list and the working ones for the Wii will be exported into the "mame games" folder.

From there take your MAME games and put them in the mame--->roms folder on the Wii SD card
for the boxart go to wiiflow--->boxcovers--->mame and place them there.

enjoy!
