***Basic info***

PS1 needs bios! ----> scph1001.bin

You will need Python installed on your PC to run the script.

This tool will only read UNZIPPED games for this system. For the Playstation 1 the game extension will have to be in ".bin & .cue" format

Boxart cover size is 1090x442

in order for Wiiflow to see your boxart, all title names from both the "games" and "boxart" need to match 100% 
Example:[game title].cue and [game title].cue.png.   (cover art file extension must end in ".cue.png" or wiiflow will not read it).


******* THIS TOOL WILL NOT READ GAMES WITH MULTIPLE .BIN TRACKS ********

***Using the tool***

Before using the tool you need to setup the folders inside.

Place your PS1 games in the "ps1 games" folder making sure they are unzipped and have the .bin and .cue files in their individual game folders.

after that if you have your boxart, also make sure that it's unzipped and placed in the "ps1 cover art" folder.

(if you have folders called "ALT" or "demo" inside the box art file you downloaded) i usually just delete them. I just use the default ones for my region (USA).
alt files can cause duplicate titles after the conversion process to appear and make covers not work.


assuming you have both of those things done, then you're good to go to run the script. (Provided you have python installed).


all you have to do from here is just open "DAT-PS1-Wiiflow-Tool.py" and follow the prompts. 


Your renamed boxart for use in Wiiflow will now be located in "renamed cover art" with the file extensions fixed for you! (.cue.png)


*****FILE LOCATIONS*****

after thats done, assuming you followed my guide "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-aV3whflOQ&t=513s"

then you can place the ps1 games when done into the "Wiisxrx--->isos" folder on your Wii SD card

and place the box art into the "Wiiflow--->boxcovers---->playstation" folder

******OR*******

When the script is complete you can auto transfer your files to the SD/USB by running the "Transfer to SD-USB (PlayStation).py" script and following the prompts.


Lastly place your bios into the wiisxrx/bios folder

and thats it! Enjoy. -Below Average Gaming
